## Abstract
Our project allows for the controlling and customization of  the brightness of our lights. We have built a light dimmer with two settings: auto brightness and touch sensor. This means that users have the flexibility to choose between automatic adjustments based on ambient lighting or manual control through touch input.

Our project has a dynamic webpage that provides real-time updates of the light's dimness value. This webpage is designed to refresh every second, ensuring that users have the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding the brightness level. Not only does it display the current dimness value, but it also indicates which setting the light is currently reading from. In addition to the web-based monitoring, we have implemented a button, allowing users to seamlessly switch between the auto brightness and touch sensor modes.
